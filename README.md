# Problem Set: Final Tic-Tac-Toe in React!

### The Last Time I'll Ever Have You Make Tic-Tac-Toe. I promise. ü§ûüèø

## Directions
Refactor your Tic-Tac-Toe app _again_. You have only one goal: implement time travel. In other words, give the user the ability to go back to previous moves. This is a [working demo](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR).

Here's the deal: I don't care which tools you use for this job. I want you to reach for to solutions you believer are best for the job. This means you can `useState` or `useReducer`. You can `useContext` or not. It's your choice.

Lastly, you have a class component implementation to use for hints if you get stuck! Refactoring class components to functions is valuable practice and is also one of the objectives of this Problem Set.

Here's to your last ever Tic-Tac-Toe game of your Marcy Lab School career!

I think.

### Extra Credit
* Instead of rendering buttons, use React Router so that a user can use the browser to navigate back to previous moves.
